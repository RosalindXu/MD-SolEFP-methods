# MD-SolEFP-methods

CHL Lab
Rosalind J. Xu 18' June 2018


This folder contains all protocols / scripts / input files for doing md, solefp, lineshape conversion, qmmm, and force field parametrization. 

To best understand contents in this folder, please read directories and files in the following order:

1. If there is a README.txt: read it first
2. Read directories / files with the smallest index first, then move on to larger indexes or directories / files that are not indexed. 
--> For example, the first file you should be reading (after this README.txt) is 0-hardwares & softwares / 1-desktop / 0-software-for-desktop.docx

There is another copy of this folder on https://github.com/RosalindXu/MD-SolEFP-methods
If you have questions or get stuck, ask Casey. 
Additionally, Casey has all my project files as well as electronic notes, which could be helpful


Best Wishes,
Rosalind Xu
